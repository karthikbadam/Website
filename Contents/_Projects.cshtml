    Proxemics
</p>
<p>
Proxemic Lens is an interaction technique for exploring multiscale visualizations using explicit gestures as
well as proxemics: the spatial relations between people and physical artifacts such as their distance, orientation, and movement.
The technique is intended for collaborative environments with large wall displays and is based on focus+context lenses that show a
detailed view of the selected content from an overview visualization. Each lens is controlled by both proxemics and mid-air gestures.
In this paper, we discuss different design considerations for implicit and explicit interactions made possible through the Proxemic
Lens, and perform a user study to find a balance between implicit and explicit interaction styles. Our findings indicate that users favor
proxemic interactions for navigation and collaboration, but prefer using explicit mid-air gestures to perform actions that are perceived
to be direct, such as terminating a lens composition. Furthermore, the use of multiple mid-air gestures for a single analytics task was
deemed to require high physical effort resulting in low accuracy. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid technique utilizing both
proxemics and mid-air gestures, along with several examples for applying Proxemic Lens technique to various datasets.

    PolyChrome
</p>
<p>
PolyChrome is a web application framework for sharing interactions
and managing display space of various devices in collaborative
settings. The framework is built entirely in JavaScript and the
participating devices need only a modern web browser to utilize
PolyChrome. PolyChrome provides three distinct contributions to the community
building collaborative visualizations: (1) It distributes legacy
visualizations for the web across multiple devices and share the interactions.
This can be helpful in using websites that invite social
analysis of a visualization such as ManyEyes collaboratively, (2)
provides the necessary interaction event and display space distribution
mechanisms to create new collaborative web visualizations for
multiple users and devices. This is useful for designing web visualization
sites that allow all types of collaboration, including the four
combinations of synchronous vs. asynchronous and co-located vs. distributed collaboration, (3) provides ability to store the interactions
of users for replay, conflict, and consistency management.

    skWiki <br/>
</p>
<p>
skWiki is a web application framework for collaborative creativity in digital multimedia projects, including text, hand-drawn sketches, and photographs. skWiki overcomes common drawbacks of existing wiki software by providing a rich viewer/editor architecture for all media types that is integrated into the web browser itself, thus avoiding dependence on client-side editors. Instead of files, skWiki uses the concept of paths as trajectories of persistent state over time. skWiki also provides a path viewer to visualize and navigate through the various paths/trajectories created during a collaborative design process.
